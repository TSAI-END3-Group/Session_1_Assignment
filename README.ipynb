    "## **Q1: What is a neural network neuron?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a tonne of documentation available on the internet and in books which describe the neural networks in all kind of ways. Some with a lot of mathematics while some make it so simple that it stops making any real sense. This is a midway version\n",

    "* Take some input features x1,x2,x3… (These input signals can come from either the raw data set or from neurons positioned at a previous layer of the neural network)\n",
    "* These features have a relative importance which is weight: w1,w2,w3,..\n",
    "* The neuron will perform a weighted sum of the input features \n",
    "z=x1.w1+x2.w2+....\n",
    "\n",
    "* This output value is then passed through an activation function which transforms the magnitude of the value. This helps the neurons to be used to solve complex problems. Because now we have the means to add some extra flavor to the value. E.g. if the problem is a classification then we want the number computed by the neuron to translate into some class or sometimes we want the values to be always between a certain interval like (-1,1) or we want to accept a positive value (RELU). Sometimes this logic could be written as set of rules, but it becomes difficult to come up with all the corner cases and hence we make use of a mathematical function to do so\n",

    "There is a beautiful analogy given by “Peter Ashman” in this quora post https://www.quora.com/Why-do-neural-networks-need-an-activation-function  on the importance of the activation function which basically suggests that the activation function helps in adjusting the neurons to output the values which can be a non linear combination and hence help in establishing complex decision boundaries for the given input boundaries \n",

    "## **Q2: What is the use of the learning rate?**\n",
    "The neural network needs to learn the weights for the input values that are being passed. Now the learning is done by first initializing the weights of the parameters to some value (as described in the weight initialization section) and then with each training example trying to adjust the weights so that the prediction and the actual value of training data is almost same. In other words make the loss minimal (see the loss section)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can consider error as a mountain which we want to descend  or in other words we want to reduce the error and make it as small as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/lr2.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two aspects when we are adjusting the weights of the parameters. \n",
    "1. **The direction (gradient)** : in which direction to move . Move in the direction \n",
    "which reduces the error. By taking the derivative of the error with respect to the weight $\\partial L/ \\partial w $ we get the direction that we should take\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The step size (learning rate)**. How much to move. Should we move fast or slow is critical in reaching the minimal point. Learning rate is the size of each step that the network will be taking when it is descending the error mountain.  Larger learning rate means that the network will learn faster\n",
    "(since it is descending the mountain with larger steps) and smaller steps slower training. However we need to see when we should move fast and when to go slow as their may be a chance that we miss the minimal and get stuck somewhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/lr1.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The training should start from a relatively large learning rate because, in the beginning, random weights are far from optimal, and then the learning rate can decrease during training to allow more fine-grained weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the learning rate affects how quickly our model can converge to a local minima (aka arrive at the best accuracy). Thus getting it right from the get go would mean less time for us to train the model.\n",
    "If the learning rate is too small it will take lot of time to train while if it is very large then the updates to the parameters will be quite big and it can miss the global minima, so we need to have the right learning rate\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to save ourselves from the task of tuning the learning rate based on the error, we make use of Optimizers. They can increase or decrease the learning rate as per the need. Some of the common ones are **adam,adagrad, rmsprop**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Illustrative Intuition on Learning Rate:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate is how quickly a network abandons old beliefs for new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: If a child sees 10 examples of cats and all of them have orange fur, it will think that cats have orange fur and will look for orange fur when trying to identify a cat. Now it sees a black a cat and her parents tell her it's a cat (supervised learning). With a large “learning rate”, it will quickly realize that “orange fur” is not the most important feature of cats. With a small learning rate, it will think that this black cat is an outlier and cats are still orange.\n",
    "The point is that a higher learning rate means the network changes its mind more quickly. That can be good in the case above but can also be bad. If the learning rate is too high, it might start to think that all cats are black even though it has seen more orange cats than black ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you want to find a learning rate that is low enough that the network converges to something useful, but high enough that you don't have to spend years training it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Loss=abs(predicted-actual)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the neural network is a supervised learning algorithm, like any other supervised learning we have the training set with the known outputs. ‘Loss’ helps us to understand how much the predicted value differ from actual value.\n",

    "The smaller the loss, the better a job the model is doing. The larger the loss, the more our model needs to be trained to increase its accuracy.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Typically, with neural networks, we seek to minimize the error. As such, the objective function is often referred to as a cost function or a loss function and the value calculated by the loss function is referred to as simply **loss**\n",
    " \n",
    "The function we want to minimize or maximize is called the **objective function** or criterion. When we are minimizing it, we may also call it the **cost function, loss function, or error function**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the loss we can find out if the network is learning or not. The training loss should decrease during the learning.\n",
    " \n",
    "The loss function is required for the neural network parameters to learn. If the output value is absurd then the loss will be very high and hence the correction that we will do on the weights will be high $ \\partial L/ \\partial w $ will be very high and hence the update will be high\n",

    "On the other hand if the output value is in line with the predicted value then the Loss will be less and hence the correction to the weight will be less (or the network is trained)\n",
    " \n",
    "Now the loss is calculated using an objective function or a loss function . The choice of the objective function is important for the learning. As I explained that Loss is like the compass that is telling how much to move and in which direction to move. If that compass starts giving wrong results the movements will not be accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "Different loss functions will give different errors for the same prediction, and thus have a considerable effect on the performance of the model\n",
    " \n",
    "The loss function should be such that it should be able to converge (the error should tend to 0 or reach a minima)  and should be differentiable (as we need to find the partial derivatives to estimate the change in the weight)\n",
    " \n",
    "More concretely if the loss function is not good then the correction is not correctly done and we will not be able to find the optimal weight.\n",
